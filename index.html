                    <p class="text-muted alinea" style="text-align: justify">
                        In the last few years, Brexit has been one of the most trending topics around the world. 
                        Between 2015 and Britain's official EU exit in February 2020, countless discussions and debates have been generated around the subject. 
                        Opponents speculated that the influence of Brexit would have negative impacts on certain sectors while supporters claimed the opposite. 
                        People coming from different backgrounds had a take on the matter, where views and opinions diversified and contrasted. 
                        This made it hard to determine which side was majoritarian and had an edge on the debate and who was the losing side until the EU referdum
                        that declared, in numbers, those in favor of Brexit as the winning side. <br> 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted alinea" style="text-align: justify">
                        The problem with the referudum is that it is anonymous and therefore does not tell much about the attributes of the people who voted. 
                        On the other hand, analyzing data sets that reveal the identity of individuals such as quotations or surveys that are not anonymous, makes it possible to obtain such information. 
                        In contrast to surveys or polls, quotations span over a period of time and allow therefore to track the evolution of opinions about Brexit. 
                        In fact, the debates around Brexit did not end with the referdum: they were just yet to start. And therefore we ask ourselves: <b>"How did the perception of Brexit evolve after the referundum?"</b>
                         <br>

                        The study aims at analyzing the evolution of the perception of Brexit throughout the years (2016 - 2020) using a quantitative approach that 
                        aggregates the views about Brexit by sector, country, age, gender and profession of speakers. <br>

                 Brexit has a direct and crucial impact on the British's lives. 
                 So it would be relevant to start by analysing the evolution of perception of Brexit among the British specially after the turmoil of the referundum.
                </p>
                <div style="text-align: center"><iframe width="100%" height="400" scrolling="no" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200" src="pie_chart.html"></iframe></div>

                The pie charts show that the perception of Brexit became less positive throughout the years and rather more negative except for 2020. 
                The drop in popularity in the first years following the referundum might be explained by different reasons:
                    <ul class="text-muted" style="text-align: justify;" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
                        <li>After brexit, the winners (those who voted to leave the EU) had a lesser need to be vocal about their position since they succeeded in passing the exit decision.
                            On the contrary, the losing side had to defend their position and try to argument that Brexit is a bad idea for the country.
                        </li>
                        <li>Some pro-brexit people, seeing the economic consequences of the referendum, <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/brexit-city-of-london-finance-jobs-eu-uk-new-financial-report-april-2021-082815984.html">for instance the departure of some companies</a>, made them change their mind and switch sides. </li>

                <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: justify;" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200"> 
                The opposite trend in 2020 can be explained by the fact that the impact of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fbb70741-34cc-4f54-a66b-a2e4b9445f5b">Covid might have hidden or masked the impact of Brexit.</a>
                We speculate that, for instance, some of the problems related to food supply were rather blamed on the pandemic rather than the consequences of Brexit.
                In general, the perception of Brexit is rather positive than negative which is in line with the results of the referundum. So, no major switches in opinions were observed.<br>

                Using a statistical tool, Welch's t-test, the difference between the years 2018 and 2016 was found to be significant (p-value of 1.44e-7 with a chosen significance level of 0.05). 
                On the contrary, the difference between 2016 and 2020 is not significant with a p-value of 0.615. 
                These results confirm our previous speculations.

                    Brexit does not only involve the UK but it also impacts the relations it has with other countries specially EU countries. 
                    The Brexit has led to the creation of new laws that regulate trade and other aspects of the relationship between the UK and the rest of the world. 
                    In a nutshell, matters will eventually become more complicated not only for the UK but also for EU countries. 
                    Therefore, these countries did not hesitate to also give their opinion on Brexit.

                    It is important to point out that only countries for which enough data is available were kept for the analysis. 
                    The aim is not to analyse the results for all countries but rather to look at the neighbours which are the countries directly affected by the exit decision. 
                    In 2016, the perception of Brexit by the European countries was rather negative. This might be explained by the shock of the referundum where some countries perceived Brexit as the end of Europe. 
                    However, in the following year, the perception began to improve across Europe's largest economies, possibly due to due to the economic benefits of the relocation of British companies to other European countries. 
                    For example, in the case of France, <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/brexit-to-bring-e150-billion-to-france-by-years-end/">financial firms moved around €150 billion from Britain to France.</a>
                    In 2020, the views towards Brexit where relatively neutral except for Germany that stood its ground.
                    Italy went from being very negative about Brexit in 2016 to being positive about it in 2020. It is the country that switched its opinion the most. 
                </p>
                    
                <p class="text-muted alinea" style="text-align: justify;" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200"> 
                Even though the United States is not a direct neighbour of the UK, their opinion is also interesting as they have been in favour of the Brexit all along. 
                This is not surprising either as the US benefits from the instability of Europe and the potential new trade agreements that would result from a new privileged relationship with the UK. 
                It also interesting to look at Russia that has been negative towards Brexit all along. This is a surprising result and is not in line with our expectations that Russia would be neutral towards Brexit.

                    Now that we have an overview, let's get to the heart of the matter with an analysis of the perception of Brexit by sector. 
                Indeed, an analysis at the country level is not necessarily very instructive given the heterogeneity of opinions within the same country. 
                It is impossible to capture all opinions, but by grouping them by sector we believe that the results will be more interpretable.

                    The cross that appears in the heat map due to the health columns having a very low p-value means that the distribution of sentiment in the health sector is statistically different from the distributions of the other sectors. 
                    Then if we look at the pychart we see that in the health sector there is generally a much more negative sentiment than in the other sectors. 
                    This can be explained by a

                    The Pearson correlation was then computed between the two. The exchange stocks for which the absolute value of Pearson correlation was greater 0.15 were kept for the analysis. 
                    When the value of the correlation is negative, it means that when the number of quotations about Brexit increases, the value of the derivative  
                    decreases and vice versa. In a nutshell, a negative correlation shows the negative impact of Brexit: it makes investors reluctant and make them prefer selling their shares.
                    This is the case for all the stock except for POLYMETAL INTERNATIONAL PLC. 
                    It is important to note that the value of the Pearson correlation does not exceed 0.3 in absolute value for all stock markets, which is still a weak correlation. 
                    It is important to point out that correlation is not causation! The disturbance in the stock market might be explained by the presence of other factors or confounders that have not been explored in the course of the study.

                        There are many reasons to why the analysis may not be fully valid. Some of the limitations are 
                        listed below:

                            <li> <u>Limitations related to the dataset:</u>
                                Quotes from quotebank about Brexit are a subset of what was said about the topic. Having more quotations might change the results and analysis 
                                In addition, speaker attribution might not always be accurate. This is problematic because a lot of information depends on the speaker, so a faulty attribution of the speaker has a direct impact on the interpretation of the data. 
                                Furthermore, the data is imbalanced among years, countries, age and gender.

                                A negatively labeled quotations by the Sentiment Analysis does not necessarily imply that a speaker is against Brexit.
